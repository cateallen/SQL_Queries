#  SQL Data ETL Process/Validating - Country to Country Import/Export Products
This is a collection of SQL Queries from a large unstandardized Country to Country Import/Export Dataset, this data set was divided between historical data that was already imported into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and data that I imported to add to the dataset for the current years. From there performed the required database transformation, schema development, data table lookups, data validation, and transformation (pivoting, removing unwanted characters, etc.) for it to then be used for a product trade analysis
